Step 1 - Define 2 classes.  Above int main()

Create a class called PLAYER

                string name

                getName()

                setName( string )

                default constructor - set name to 'Unknown'

                parm constructor - set name to one name on list of names below

Create a class Called TEAM 

                Use pointers:  player *  ptrPlayer1.... * ptrPlayer7  ... or ... User an Array of players....

                ( Aggregation - use one pointer or index for each player )

                printAllNames()

                default constructor - assign each pointer to a player to null/ or array player to unassigned...

Step 2 - Declare instances of classes. In int main()

Instantiate 7 players

      Use parm constructor on the first 4 player names

      Use the default constructor then use setNames on the last 3 player names

      Use the following names: George, Ivan, Hang, Tuyet, Sue, Victoria and Tumbo

Set the last 3 player names using setNames

Add any 5 of the player to the basket ball team, one at a time (5 statements - pass player pointer )

Add all 7 of the players to the soccer team ( 7 statements - pass player pointer )
